<h1> MIT (Applied) Categories Seminar </h1>

<p class="big"> 
The MIT Categories Seminar is an informal research seminar in category theory and categorical modelling. We meet each <strong>Thursday, 4.30pm to 5.30pm</strong> in <strong>MIT 2-255</strong>. Sometimes notes from the seminar are published <a href='https://categoricalmodeling.wordpress.com/'>here</a> (please feel free to contribute).

  "Higher categories" are algebraic structures which generalise categories, in the same way that categories generalise sets. The theory of these structures is ubiquitous in many areas of application of category theory. In this talk, we will motivate higher structure from applications in logic, type theory and programming languages. Surprisingly, a formulation of higher categories which is amendable to computer implementation has been missing for decades — with homotopy type theory being a notable exception of the special case of “higher groupoids”. Starting from elementary observations about compositionality in higher dimensions, will sketch a combinatorial approach to higher categories that gives rise to a programming language which we call “Globular” and which comes with an elegant geometric model. We will see that programs in Globular can capture complex higher-dimensional geometric deformations, and learn how, for instance, they can capture higher homotopy groups of spheres and other interesting geometric facts.

System Dynamics is a moniker coined by Jay Forrester over 50 years ago at MIT, when computers were just beginning to be used to simulate the behaviors of complex models of social and economic processes. Today it has a substantial following in business schools, management consulting firms, and some multinational corporations, with the goal of teaching "Systems Thinking" to their respective stake holders (see <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=fDzhnQEACAAJ" style="display:inline">"Business Dynamics"</a> by John Sterman). While it has since branched out into more sophisticated agent-based and dynamic network models (see <a href="https://www.systemdynamics.org/assets/docs/sdorabm.pdf" style="display:inline">this short article</a>), it was initially based on a diagrammatic language for nonlinear ODEs that continues to play a central role in its applications. This talk will introduce this language and give some examples, with the hope that the audience will discover some analogies, and new applications, for the categorical formalisms it has developed for modeling and analyzing systems in a broader sense.

What is a point?
</button>
</p>

<div class="collapse" id="boro">
  <div class="card card-body">
The idea is to explore the concept "Point", to look at it from different perspectives and see the connections given by the Stone Duality and the Gelfand Duality. Starting from a topological perspective, a point as an element of a topological space, we'll see the correspondences with ultrafilters, global elements in the category of Stone Spaces, morphisms that have as codomain the initial algebra 2 and how this morphisms correspond to valuations of a language in classical logic. We'll then go to boolean valued models, see how the points there have a probabilistic behavior and see some interesting consequences given by doing the forcing method through principal ultrafilters vs non-principal ultrafilters.Then we'll see the equivalences given by the Gelfand Duality: global elements in the category of locally compact spaces, characters of commutative C* algebras, maximal ideals, pure states (as positive, normalized functionals) and irreducible representations.
